    "   1. Fisrt Processing Chain\n",
    "      1. DC component was removed by applying a highpass filter\n",
    "      2. The filter signal was cut into 5-second windows\n",
    "      3. statistical and frequency-domain features(e.g. peak frequency) were computed\n",
    "      4. the spectral energy (PSD( fEMG )) was computed in seven evenly spaced frequency bands from 0 to 350 Hz\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Second Processing Chain\n",
    "      1. lowpass filter (50 Hz) was applied to the raw EMG signal. \n",
    "      2. Next, the processed signal was segmented into 60-second windows. \n",
    "      3. On these windows different peak features, e.g. number #peaks EMG and meanamplitude μAmp EMG , were computed. \n",
    " \n",
    "For a more detailed description of EMG-based features, we refer the reader to Wijsman et al. [31].\n",
